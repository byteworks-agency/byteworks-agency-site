        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">1. Who we are</h2>
        <p>
          ByteWorks (“we”, “us”, “our”) is an online web design and maintenance studio.
          We design, host, and maintain marketing and transactional websites for entrepreneurs and small businesses.
          This policy describes how we process personal data when you browse our sites, request a quote, or use the
          admin tools we provide to our clients.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">2. Personal data we collect</h2>
        <p>We only collect the data we need to deliver and improve our services:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li><span class="font-medium">Inquiry details</span>: name, email, phone, business name, project goals, and any message you share through our contact or quote forms.</li>
          <li><span class="font-medium">Account data</span>: if you access the ByteWorks admin portal, we store the email used for login, basic profile information, and authentication metadata provided by Supabase Auth.</li>
          <li><span class="font-medium">Billing records</span>: purchase history, invoices, quotes, currencies, and payment references managed through our Prisma/PostgreSQL database.</li>
          <li><span class="font-medium">Usage data</span>: anonymised visit metrics (page views, referrers, approximate location) produced by privacy-friendly analytics and server logs. These do not include advertising identifiers.</li>
          <li><span class="font-medium">Technical diagnostics</span>: IP address, browser, device type, error traces collected automatically to secure the platform and troubleshoot incidents.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">3. How we use the data</h2>
        <p>We process personal data for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>Responding to inquiries, preparing proposals, and onboarding new projects.</li>
          <li>Operating our admin dashboard: managing quotes, invoices, lead submissions, reminders, and content updates.</li>
          <li>Providing technical support, monitoring uptime, generating backups, and improving user experience.</li>
          <li>Sending essential service communications (maintenance windows, policy updates, billing notices).</li>
          <li>Meeting contractual and legal obligations, including accounting and fraud prevention.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2">
          We rely on legitimate interest to secure our infrastructure and run analytics, and on contractual necessity or your consent for the rest. Where required, we request explicit permission (for example, opt-in marketing emails).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">4. Providers &amp; international transfers</h2>
        <p>
          We host infrastructure on Vercel (EU/US regions) and store operational data in Supabase (USA/EU) using encrypted PostgreSQL databases.
          Payment information is handled via the processors stated on each invoice (e.g. Stripe or direct bank transfer); we never store raw card data.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          When we engage sub-processors, we make sure contracts include confidentiality and security obligations aligned with this policy. Data may be transferred outside your jurisdiction and is protected by standard contractual clauses or equivalent safeguards.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">5. Cookies &amp; analytics</h2>
        <p>
          Our public site uses first-party cookies to remember language preferences and session state. We also run lightweight analytics
          (Plausible or Cloudflare Insights) that track aggregate trends without personal identifiers. You can block cookies in your browser;
          essential features such as the admin session may require them.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">6. Data retention</h2>
        <p>
          Inquiry data is stored for up to 12 months after the last interaction. Client records (quotes, invoices, signed agreements) are retained for seven (7) years to comply with accounting rules unless laws require a longer period.
          Backups are encrypted, stored for up to 30 days, and then purged. If you ask us to delete information, we remove it from active systems and schedule deletion from backups during the next cycle.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">7. Security practices</h2>
        <p>
          We implement role-based access control, HTTPS everywhere, automatic dependency updates, and continuous vulnerability monitoring.
          Production credentials are stored in environment secrets, and admin access requires multi-factor authentication. Despite best efforts, no system is infallible; we investigate and disclose any breach that materially affects your data.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">8. Your choices &amp; rights</h2>
        <p>You can:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
          <li>Ask us to correct inaccurate information or delete it when permitted by law.</li>
          <li>Restrict or object to certain processing (for example, analytics cookies).</li>
          <li>Export your admin data (quotes, invoices, submissions) in accessible formats.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2">

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">9. Children</h2>
        <p>
          Our services target business owners and teams. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 16. If you believe a child has provided personal information, please reach out so we can delete it promptly.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">10. Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>
          We will update this notice whenever our practices change. The “effective” date above indicates the latest revision. Substantial updates are communicated to active clients via email or the admin dashboard.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">11. Contact</h2>
