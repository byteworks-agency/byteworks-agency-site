const faqs = [
  { q: 'How fast can you deliver my website?', a: 'Start launches in 7–10 business days after we receive copy, logo, and images. Pro/Elite take 2–4 weeks depending on scope and review speed.' },
  { q: 'What do you need from me to start?', a: 'Logo, brand colors (if any), page outline, basic text, images (or placeholders), and a contact email/phone. For e-commerce: product names, prices, and photos.' },
  { q: 'What does the monthly update include?', a: "Small, scoped tasks: text/image edits, minor layout tweaks, product changes, or simple section adjustments. Time is limited per plan and doesn't roll over." },
  { q: 'What is not included in the monthly update?', a: 'New pages, redesigns, complex integrations, payment gateways, or large content production. Those require a quote or a plan/add-on change.' },
  { q: 'Do you write the copy?', a: 'We provide structure and light editing. Full copywriting is not included by default but can be quoted.' },
  { q: 'Do you design logos or brand kits?', a: 'Yes. Our Basic Branding add-on includes logo (primary/alternate), color palette, typography suggestions, and social avatars/banners.' },
  { q: 'Do you work with a CMS?', a: 'We avoid heavy CMS by default for speed/reliability and we manage updates for you. If you truly need a CMS, we can quote a suitable option.' },
  { q: 'Is bilingual included?', a: 'Yes. English and Spanish routes are included by default. If you only need one language, we can keep the other hidden.' },
  { q: 'How does hosting work?', a: 'Hosting, SSL, and basic monitoring are included in every plan. We deploy on reliable infrastructure and handle the technical bits for you.' },
  { q: 'Do I own my domain and content?', a: 'Yes. You own your domain and all content. We operate the technical stack while your subscription is active.' },
  { q: 'Can you use my existing domain?', a: 'Yes. We help point your DNS to the new site. We can also help you buy a new domain if needed.' },
  { q: 'Do you create email accounts?', a: 'Email hosting is not included. We recommend using your preferred third-party provider and can share simple setup steps.' },
  { q: 'What about SEO?', a: 'All plans include basic SEO (clean structure, meta, sitemap). For ongoing improvements and local positioning we offer the Advanced SEO add-on.' },
  { q: 'Do you set up business profiles?', a: 'Yes, as part of the SEO add-on we assist with local business profile setup/updates to improve local visibility.' },
  { q: 'Analytics included?', a: "Yes. We include a lightweight, privacy-friendly analytics via our internal dashboard. You'll be able to see visits and basic metrics." },
  { q: 'E-commerce included?', a: 'The E-Commerce Pro plan enables a simple catalog, cart, and manual checkout (no gateways). If you need online payments, we can quote an integration.' },
  { q: 'Product limits?', a: 'E-Commerce Pro covers up to 20 products. The Extended Catalog add-on lets you add blocks of 20. Over 60 products usually requires a custom plan.' },
  { q: 'How are payments handled?', a: 'Monthly or yearly subscription. You can upgrade anytime. Cancellation stops future renewals at the end of the current term.' },
  { q: 'Can I cancel anytime? What do I get?', a: 'Yes. On request we can export a static copy and provide assets/data within the limits described in our Terms.' },
  { q: 'Will my site be fast and mobile-friendly?', a: 'Yes. Performance and responsive design are defaults. We target green Lighthouse scores where practical for your content.' },
  { q: 'Accessibility?', a: 'We follow sensible accessibility practices in structure, colors, and interactions. Full audits/certifications are not included by default.' },
  { q: 'Backups and security?', a: 'Backups are automatic. SSL is included. We use a small, modern stack with read-only deploys and keep dependencies up to date.' },
  { q: 'Support hours and response times?', a: 'Monday–Friday, 9:00–18:00 (AST). Typical targets: ≤ 4h critical, ≤ 24h standard, ≤ 48h general (see Terms).' },
  { q: 'How do we communicate?', a: 'WhatsApp and email. Quick questions get quick answers; larger changes go through the monthly update or a quoted task.' },
  { q: 'Can you migrate my current site?', a: 'Yes. We can migrate core pages and assets to the new structure. Complex blogs or stores may require an add-on or custom quote.' },
