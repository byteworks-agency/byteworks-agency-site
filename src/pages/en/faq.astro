const faqs = [
  { q: 'How fast can you deliver my website?', a: 'Start usually launches in 7–10 business days after we receive copy, logo and images. Pro/Elite take 2–4 weeks depending on scope and review speed.' },
  { q: 'What do you need from me to start?', a: 'Your logo, brand colors (if any), page outline, basic text, images (or we can use placeholders), and a contact email/phone. For e‑commerce: product names, prices and photos.' },
  { q: 'What does the monthly update include?', a: 'Small, scoped tasks: text or image changes, minor layout tweaks, product edits, or simple section adjustments. Time is limited per plan and doesn’t roll over.' },
  { q: 'What is not included in the monthly update?', a: 'New pages, redesigns, complex integrations, payment gateways, or large content production. Those require a quote or a plan/add‑on change.' },
  { q: 'Do you write the copy?', a: 'We provide structure and guidance, and can lightly polish text. Full copywriting is not included by default but can be quoted.' },
  { q: 'Do you design logos or brand kits?', a: 'Yes. Our Basic Branding add‑on includes logo (primary/alternate), color palette, typography suggestions and social avatars/banners.' },
  { q: 'Do you work with a CMS?', a: 'By default we avoid heavy CMS for speed and reliability. We maintain your site for you. If you truly need a CMS, we can quote a suitable option.' },
  { q: 'Is bilingual included?', a: 'Yes. English and Spanish routes are included by default. If you only need one language we can keep the other hidden.' },
  { q: 'How does hosting work?', a: 'Hosting, SSL and basic monitoring are included in every plan. We deploy on reliable infrastructure and handle technical bits for you.' },
  { q: 'Do I own my domain and content?', a: 'Yes. You own your domain and all content. We operate the technical stack while your subscription is active.' },
  { q: 'Can you use my existing domain?', a: 'Yes. We help point your DNS to the new site. We can also help you buy a new domain if needed.' },
  { q: 'Do you create email accounts?', a: 'Email hosting is not included. We recommend Google Workspace or your preferred provider and can share simple setup steps.' },
  { q: 'What about SEO?', a: 'All plans include basic SEO (clean structure, meta, sitemap). For ongoing improvements and local positioning we offer the Advanced SEO add‑on.' },
  { q: 'Do you set up Google Business?', a: 'Yes, as part of the SEO add‑on we assist with Google Business Profile setup/updates to improve local visibility.' },
  { q: 'Analytics included?', a: 'Yes. We can set up Google Analytics or a privacy‑friendly option. You’ll be able to see visits and basic metrics.' },
  { q: 'E‑commerce included?', a: 'The E‑Commerce Pro plan enables a simple catalog, cart and manual checkout (no gateways). If you need online payments, we can quote a custom integration.' },
  { q: 'Product limits?', a: 'E‑Commerce Pro covers up to 20 products. The Extended Catalog add‑on lets you add blocks of 20. Over 60 products usually requires a custom plan.' },
  { q: 'How are payments handled?', a: 'Monthly or yearly subscription. You can upgrade anytime. Cancellation stops future renewals at the end of the current term.' },
  { q: 'Can I cancel anytime? What do I get?', a: 'Yes. On request, we can export a static copy and provide your assets/data within the limits described in our Terms.' },
  { q: 'How many revisions do I get?', a: 'We aim for short feedback loops. During build, we include practical review rounds. After launch, the monthly updates keep improving the site.' },
  { q: 'Will my site be fast and mobile‑friendly?', a: 'Yes. Performance and responsive design are part of our defaults. We target green Lighthouse scores where practical for your content.' },
  { q: 'Accessibility?', a: 'We follow sensible accessibility practices in structure, colors and interactions. Full audits or compliance certifications are not included by default.' },
  { q: 'Backups and security?', a: 'Backups are automatic. SSL is included. We use a small, modern stack with read‑only deploys and keep dependencies up‑to‑date.' },
  { q: 'Support hours and response times?', a: 'Monday–Friday, 9:00–18:00 (AST). Typical targets: ≤ 4h for critical issues, ≤ 24h for standard support, ≤ 48h for general inquiries (see Terms).' },
  { q: 'How do we communicate?', a: 'WhatsApp and email. Quick questions get quick answers; larger changes go through the monthly update or a quoted task.' },
  { q: 'Can you migrate my current site?', a: 'Yes. We can migrate core pages and assets to the new structure. Complex blogs or stores may require an add‑on or custom quote.' },
  { q: 'Can we add a blog later?', a: 'Yes. Our Blog add‑on enables a simple news/blog section with categories and SEO‑ready templates.' },
  { q: 'Can you integrate payments later?', a: 'Yes. We can quote payment gateways or custom flows when you are ready.' },
  { q: 'Legal/privacy help?', a: 'We set up basic analytics and structure. You should provide your own legal texts (Privacy/Terms). We can add them to your site.' },
