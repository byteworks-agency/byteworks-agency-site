  { q: "What does maintenance include?", a: "Hosting, SSL, backups, core updates, and minor fixes. Monthly content updates are included per plan." },
  { q: "Can I switch plans later?", a: "Yes. Upgrade/downgrade anytime. We adjust billing so you don’t overpay and keep service uninterrupted." },
  { q: "How fast can you launch?", a: "Start typically ships in 3–7 days depending on content. Pro/Elite/E-Commerce may take longer due to custom pages/integrations." },
  { q: "Do I own my domain and content?", a: "Yes. Your brand, domain, and content are yours. If you ever migrate, we provide a clean export." },
  { q: "How do WhatsApp forms work?", a: "Contact/quote/booking forms can be sent directly to WhatsApp. In Elite/E-Commerce, we can also log to Sheets and send notifications." },
  { q: "Mini-store & E-Commerce: who manages products?", a: "By default, ByteWorks manages items (add, edit, remove). If you prefer self-management, we enable it on request with a quick guide and support." }
